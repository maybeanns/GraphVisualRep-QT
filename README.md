# GraphVisualRep-QT
DSA course assignment for visually representing graphs with circular edges, adjacency matrix, and some other micro functionalities.Made with QT creator version-11

## Assignment Statement
In this assignment, you have to create an application for graph processing which should have the following features:
1. Take as input the number of nodes in the graph
2. Take as input the density of the graph
3. Store the graph in an adjacency matrix.
4. Add the following features/functions to your application
  ◉ Give a node to show its degree
  ◉ Find the node with the maximum degree
  ◉ Find the node with a minimum degree
  ◉ Display the raw adjacency matrix 
  ◉ Give a node to find all its neighbors

## Approach
QGraphicsScene- for displaying the graph
QGraphicsEllipseItem- for ellipse shape of the nodes/vertices
QTime - for randomly generating the edges for nodes to save time
QCoreApplication - provide loops for events without UI
XML - for designing
Basic CPP graph logic to find max and min node degree
QLineEdit Widget - for input boxes
QTextEdit - for displaying the adjacency matrix of the graphs
QPushButtons - for buttons

## Screenshot of GUI
○ 0<=density<=1
○ Adjacency Matrix have a scroll effect to see it
○ Fing Neighbors push-button produces message-box
